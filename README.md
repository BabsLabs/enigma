This is the README for the Enigma project.

Enigma is the final project for the Mod 1 program at Turing.

My self assessment is as follows:

Functionality - 3.5

I gave myself a 3.5 on functionality because although I can crack the code the process takes a while - especially if I don’t have a date in the crack method. Beyond that I have an Enigma class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. In addition I have command lines which work in the described fashion.

Object Oriented Programming - 3

I think my OOP is a solid three on this project. I do have 4 classes and they have single responsibilities. I only have 2 methods that are longer than 7 lines and none of my classes are more than 100 lines. In addition my variable names are clear and accurate.

Test Driven Development - 4

My test names are clear as can be.  The majority of the methods have tests for a number of different test cases beyond the basic interaction pattern. In addition my rake file and simplecov show 100 percent coverage.

Version Control - 3.5

I have 40 commits and 11 pull requests. It feels like you really don’t need to make as many pull requests when working on a project alone but I do understand why it Is a good habit to get into. That being said I still tried to make my commit messages clear and even added some comments to pull requests.
